# Parser

This test task for internship implements a basic parser for a subset of the Kotlin programming language. It focuses on parsing function declarations, including nested functions, and outputs a JSON representation of the declarations.

## Components

The parser consists of two main components:

1. **Lexer (`lexer.py`)**: This component tokenizes the input Kotlin code into a series of tokens, recognizing keywords, identifiers, punctuation, and handling unexpected characters.
2. **Parser (`parser.py`)**: This component parses the tokens generated by the lexer to construct a structured JSON output that captures the function declarations with their names, parameters, return types, and bodies.

## Usage

To use the parser, provide a Kotlin source file as input. The parser will generate a JSON file named `test.json` containing the parsed declarations.

### Running the Parser

Navigate to the project directory and run:

```bash
python main.py <path-to-kotlin-file>
```

Example:

```bash
python main.py example.kt
```

### Output

The output JSON will list all function declarations found in the provided Kotlin source file. For example:

```json
{
  "declarations": [
    {
      "type": "function",
      "name": "fizzBuzz",
      "parameters": [{ "name": "n", "type": "Int" }],
      "returnType": "Unit",
      "body": "..."
    }
  ]
}
```

## Features

- Tokenization of basic Kotlin syntax.
- Parsing of function declarations, including nested functions.
- Error handling for unexpected tokens.

## Limitations

- The parser currently only supports basic function parsing and does not handle other Kotlin features like classes, interfaces, or control structures.
- Error reporting is minimal and may not provide detailed insights into syntax errors.
